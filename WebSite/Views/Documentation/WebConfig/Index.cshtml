<p>
If you have an ASP.NET MVC or WebForms web site, you can configure your JavaScript loggers
    from your server side web.config. 
</p>
<p>
    In that case, you can also @Html.ViewLink("javascriptlogging-setjsnlogconfiguration", "configure JSNLog using server side code")<text>.</text>
</p>

<p>
    Note that 
    after 
@Html.ViewLink("downloadinstall", "installation"),
JSNLog doesn't need any additional configuration. All you need to do to start logging is 
    @Html.ViewLink("getstartedlogging", "add loggers to your JavaScript code")<text>.</text>
You only need to update your web.config if you want to change the default configuration.
</p>
<p>
During installation,
a 
    @Html.ViewLink("webconfig-jsnlog")
    will have been added to your web.config. This is the container for the other elements.
</p>





@Html.ChildrenTable(cssClass: "table medium")
