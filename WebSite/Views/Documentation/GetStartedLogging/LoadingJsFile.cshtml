    This page is about loading the jsnlog.js JavaScript file onto your pages, including as part of a

    an
    <a href="#amd">AMD module</a> or with
    <a href="#browserify">Browserify</a>.
</p>

<h2>How jsnlog.js is loaded by default</h2>
<p>
    As part of the
    @Html.ViewLink("downloadinstall", "installation", null, "addtoyourpages")<text>,</text>
    you will have included a call to the
    @Html.ViewLink("javascriptlogging-configure", "Configure")
    method in your pages, using the line <span class="term">&#64;Html.Raw(JSNLog.JavascriptLogging.Configure())</span> if you use MVC.
    That method inserts a &lt;script&gt; tag that loads the jsnlog.js file. You can verify this by doing a View Source of the page.
</p>

<p>
    The url of the jsnlog.js file to be used in the &lt;script&gt; tag is specified by the
    <span class="term">productionLibraryPath</span>
    attribute of the
    @Html.ViewLink("webconfig-jsnlog")
    in your web.config.
</p>
<h2>Stop automatic generation of script tag for jsnlog.js</h2>
<p>
    If you want to load the jsnlog.js file as part of a bundle or as an AMD module,
    you don't want the generated &lt;script&gt; tag. You can make it go away by simply removing the
    <span class="term">productionLibraryPath</span> attribute.
</p>
<p>
    The line <span class="term">&#64;Html.Raw(JSNLog.JavascriptLogging.Configure())</span>
    not only inserts the script tag (if there is a <span class="term">productionLibraryPath</span> attribute), but
    also
    takes the JSNLog configuration in your web.config and
    generates a JavaScript block in your page with that information.
</p>
<p>
    This should still happen. And it should happen before your JavaScript code executes.
</p>
<p>
    Because it doesn't delay rendering the page, a good place for
    <span class="term">&#64;Html.Raw(JSNLog.JavascriptLogging.Configure())</span>
    would be in your _Layout.cshtml or _Layout.vbhtml file, in the head of the page near the top of the file.
    That way you are sure it generates the JavaScript block before any JavaScript code runs.

<h2>Loading jsnlog.js as part of a bundle</h2>

<p>
    ASP.NET's
    <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-4/bundling-and-minification">bundling feature</a>

    optimizes loading of your CSS and JavaScripot files in Release mode.
    It does this by using minified versions of the files and combining them in bundles.
</p>

<p>
    You can add jsnlog.js to any bundle, or put it in its own bundle.
    The NuGet package installs both <span class="term">jsnlog.js</span> and the minified <span class="term">jsnlog.min.js</span>.
    That way, the bundling feature can pick the right version depending on whether the site runs in Debug mode or Release mode.
</p>

<p>
    Assuming that you intend to load both jQuery and JSNLog in every page,
    you could add jsnlog.js to the jquery bundle in your
    <span class="term">BundleConfig</span> class:
</p>

<pre>bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/jquery")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Include("~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="addedcode">.Include("~/Scripts/jsnlog.js")</span>);
</pre>
